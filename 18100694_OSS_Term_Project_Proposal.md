### 3. Description
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, I will introduce about my open source software term project. 
Its title is named "번<br>화가 범죄율 시뮬레이터". At first, I tried to make navigation but after I listened 
to the OSS<br> class, I thought machine learning is more interestring than algorithm. But I already made
<br> the city map, so I decided to put people instead of car, and make simulator with this map. It<br> 
simulates The behavior of people in main street and predicts the crime rate by information<br> time, 
day of the week, population density and etc...<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The program will consider only between 5pm-5am, when people starts to 
hangout after<br> their work. How I am going to implement this program is, I will use turtle graphics, 
tkinter<br> and sklearn package for my project, make all things as object of class such as road, building,
<br> people, and each people objects will have different blood alchol level. In korea, crime after<br> 
10pm is considered as a special crime. By this simulator, I want to find why and I will also<br> look
for how many data is needed to predict properly.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The user can pick particular day or time manually to simulate. The longer 
the user runs<br> the program, the more accurate the predict will be. *Thank you very Much!! I will do 
my best<br> for the project :D*<br><br><br><br><br>
