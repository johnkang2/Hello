### 5. For those who want to know more<br>
* 1 min of simulator time equals 1/3sec of actual time<br>
* Blue indicates people who are now here, Purple indicates people who are already playing<br>
* And yellow indicates people who will go home.
* This program uses Python tkinter and turtle.
* If you keep running it , someday the program may stop because of 'OUT OF MEMORY'.<br>
* It's because I failed to find the way to remove turtle object.<br>
* So I used only .hideturtle() and memory usage is constantly increasing.<br>
* My PC RAM is 16G and it stopped at day83.<br>
* This is the human spawn chart<br><br>
